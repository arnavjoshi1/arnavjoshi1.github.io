# Arnav Joshi's Portfolio

## About Me
Hello welcome to my portfolio! My name is Arnav Joshi and I am a graduating senior at the University of Michigan. My major is mechanical engineering, and I have 2 minors in computer science and mathematics. I'm interested in applying my engineering skills to whatever challenges I encouter in my life, and I hope this portfolio can show off the skills I know.

## School Projects
Here are the projects I've worked on in my courses at Michigan.

### Bidirectional Inverted Pendulum (ME 450)
#### Date: September 2019 - Present
For our senior design capstone project, my team and I came up with the  self-directed inverted pendulum project. The goal of the project is to design and build a 2 directional inverted pendulum frame and cart system that will move to catch a ball. 

This project was one of the most challenging projects I have worked on, and not only because of the technical difficulty. My team and I started this course with a completely different project, but our project sponsor had legal issues that affected our work, so we had to cancel the project after 1 month of working on it. Since then, our team pivoted to build a bidirectional inverted pendulum game. My team and I were able to work together and come up with the idea for this new project, and then we directed it ourselves. This has never been done before for a mechanical engineering senior design project.

The focus of my work was simulation, control, and software development. First, in MATLAB I fully simulated and LQR and PID control system, with options for balancing a pendulum or not (GIF shown below).

The project is currently a WIP, but I will be updating this page as more progress is made!

### Ball Catch-and-Sort (ME 350)
#### Date: Septemeber 2018 - December 2018
The Ball Catch-and-Sort system was my junior design project at the University of Michigan. This mechatronic system catches balls from 2 tubes, and sorts them into bins based on the balls' colors. The focus of this project was to introduce us to mechatronics and more advanced mechanical designs. I was the team leader, and worked on all aspects of the projects. I focused on dynamic simulations and circuitry. I was also in charge of manufacturing 3D printed and lathe parts while also helping with milling.

At the end of the semester, my team's project won 1st place in our division out of over 20 teams. This was due to the hard work and dedication to learn that my team and I showed all semester.

##### CAD/ADAMS
Below is the full final CAD of our project. It required many parts to be waterjet, milled, lathed, or 3D printed.
