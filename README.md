# Arnav Joshi's Portfolio

## About Me
Hello welcome to my portfolio! My name is Arnav Joshi and I am a graduating senior at the University of Michigan. My major is mechanical engineering, and I have 2 minors in computer science and mathematics. I'm interested in applying my engineering skills to whatever challenges I encouter in my life, and I hope this portfolio can show off the skills I know.

## School Projects
Here are the projects I've worked on in my courses at Michigan.

### Bidirectional Inverted Pendulum (ME 450)
#### Date: September 2019 - Present
This project was one of the most challenging projects I have worked on, and not only because of the technical difficulty. My team and I started this course with a completely different project, but our project sponsor had legal issues that affected our work, so we had to cancel the project after 1 month of working on it. Since then, our team pivoted to build a bidirectional inverted pendulum game.

The focus of my work was simulation, control, and software development. In MATLAB, I fully simulated and LQR and PID control system, with options for balancing a pendulum or not.

After the simulator was validated, I helped assemble and wire all the electronic components for our final assembly. Then, I coded our controller using C++ on an Arduino microcontroller.
